# Sensu [![Ansible Galaxy](https://img.shields.io/badge/galaxy-sensu.sensu-660198.svg?style=flat)](https://galaxy.ansible.com/sensu/sensu/) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sensu/sensu-ansible.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sensu/sensu-ansible)

[![Join the chat at https://slack.sensu.io/](https://slack.sensu.io/badge.svg)](https://slack.sensu.io/)

This role deploys a full [Sensu](https://sensuapp.org) stack, a modern, open source monitoring framework.

## Features
- Deploy a full [Sensu](https://sensuapp.org) stack, including RabbitMQ, redis, and the [Uchiwa dashboard](https://uchiwa.io/#/)
- Full support for [Sensu Enterprise](https://sensuapp.org/enterprise)
- Tight integration with the Ansible inventory - deployment of monitoring checks based on inventory grouping
- Fine grained control over dynamic client configurations
- Remote plugin deployment
- Automatic generation and dynamic deployment of SSL certs for secure communication between your clients and servers
- Highly configurable

## Batteries included, but not imposed
Along with deploying the Sensu Server, API and clients, this role can deploy a full stack: [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/), [redis](http://redis.io), and the [Uchiwa dashboard](https://uchiwa.io/#/).
However, if you want to rely on other roles/management methods to deploy/manage these services, [it's nice and easy to integrate this role](http://ansible-sensu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/integration/).
